# Safiri: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain

Safiri aims to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and blockchain by implementing **USSD-based blockchain interactions** and enabling **seamless international fiat transactions**.

Financial inclusion remains a significant challenge in many regions, especially where smartphone and internet penetration is low. Additionally, international payments are slow, costly, and reliant on intermediaries. Safiri addresses these issues by:

- Enabling **USSD-based interactions** with blockchain for users without internet access.
- Enabling **international fiat transfers** over the blockchain, allowing users to send funds (e.g., Naira) to recipients in other countries (e.g., Ghana), with the recipient receiving their **local currency** (e.g., Ghanaian Cedi) directly **without an intermediary platform or crypto conversion**.
- Allowing users with **crypto assets** to seamlessly convert them into fiat (native currency) within the Safiri ecosystem.

## Problem Statement

1. **Limited blockchain access for non-smartphone users:** Most blockchain solutions require internet and smartphones.  
2. **High cost and inefficiency of international payments:** Traditional remittance services impose high fees and long processing times.  
3. **Crypto to fiat conversion barriers:** Many users face challenges in converting crypto to fiat without centralized exchanges.  

## Technical Solution

### USSD Blockchain Implementation

- **USSD Gateway:** A middleware that interacts with blockchain smart contracts via API requests.  
- **Smart Contracts:** Managing user transactions, authentication, and funds disbursement.  
- **Off-Chain Processing:** To reduce gas fees, certain interactions (e.g., balance inquiries) are processed off-chain.  

### International Fiat Transactions

- **Stablecoin or Liquidity Pools:** Funds can be locked in stablecoin pools to facilitate fiat settlements.  

### Crypto to Fiat Conversion

- **On-Chain Swap Mechanism:** Users can swap crypto assets for stablecoins or directly for fiat.  
- **Decentralized Liquidity Pools:** Ensuring seamless conversion of crypto assets to local currency.  
- **Off-Ramp Partners:** Integration with licensed financial institutions to facilitate direct bank withdrawals or mobile money deposits.  

## Architecture Overview

1. **Frontend (USSD Interface):** Users interact via USSD menus.  
2. **Backend (Smart Contracts & Payment Rails):** Executes transactions, maintains liquidity, and ensures compliance.  
3. **Ensuring continuous availability of USSD services.**  

Safiri aims to **democratize blockchain access via USSD** while simplifying international fiat transactions. By leveraging **smart contracts** and **financial partnerships**, we provide a **scalable and secure solution** for seamless payments and crypto-to-fiat conversions.
